# Tkinter-Basics

Hi guys

This repository if for the ones who are new to creating GUIs in Python.
This is what I learnt in my vacay and hence wanted to share with you.
Important notes are marked as comments in the code for convenience

The correct order of learning the code from the files is as listed:
  1) Window Basics
  2) Label Widgets and Packs
  3) Button and Grids
  4) Frames
  5) Entry Widgets and Functions
  6) RadioButton
  7) Working with Images

I have made two application as a result of these two.
Don't forget to check them once you are thorough with all the codes and basics

Any query or suggestions, feel free to share!

!!ENJOY!!
